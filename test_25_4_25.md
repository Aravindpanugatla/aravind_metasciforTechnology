# Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

## Descriptive Statistics

### 1. What is the purpose of descriptive statistics?
Descriptive statistics summarize and organize the features of a dataset using numbers, charts, and graphs to describe patterns, trends, and distributions.

### 2. Can you explain the difference between mean, median, and mode?
- **Mean**: The average of all data points.
- **Median**: The middle value when data is arranged in order.
- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value in the dataset.

### 3. How do you interpret the standard deviation of a dataset?
Standard deviation measures how spread out the numbers in a dataset are.  
- A **low standard deviation** means data points are close to the mean.  
- A **high standard deviation** means data points are more spread out.

### 4. Describe the concept of skewness in statistics.
Skewness indicates the asymmetry of a distribution:
- **Positive skew**: Tail extends to the right.
- **Negative skew**: Tail extends to the left.
- **Zero skew**: Distribution is symmetric.

## Inferential Statistics

### 5. What is the main goal of inferential statistics?
Inferential statistics allow you to make predictions or generalizations about a population based on a sample of data.

### 6. Explain the difference between a population and a sample.
- **Population**: The entire group you're interested in studying.
- **Sample**: A smaller group selected from the population to conduct analysis.

### 7. What is a confidence interval, and how is it useful in inferential statistics?
A confidence interval is a range around a sample estimate that is likely to contain the population parameter. It reflects the degree of uncertainty associated with the sample estimate.

### 8. Define p-value.
The p-value is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.  
- A **low p-value (< 0.05)** indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
